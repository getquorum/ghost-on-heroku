amendments to the Condominium Act (the Amended Condo Act) now permit the use of **electronic balloting** along with **electronic proxies** as methods for owners to cast their votes ahead of a meeting. **GetQuorum's voting platform supports both methods of voting**. In fact, our electronic balloting system has been used successfully by our non-condo clients for the past few years.\\n\\nUnder the Amended Condo Act, a condo corporation can now permit “owners to cast a vote by “telephonic and electronic means” (i.e. electronic ballots) **if it first passes a bylaw** adopting its use. This “electronic voting bylaw\\\" must receive a simple majority of votes in order to pass (assuming quorum for the meeting is first reached). Once the bylaw is passed, electronic balloting can be used for future meetings.\\n\\n**Don’t let the passing of the bylaw get you down.** GetQuorum has been used in hundreds of bylaw votes and can help you pass your electronic balloting bylaw with our online proxy system. And once we help you pass your bylaw, GetQuorum’s online balloting system is ready to be used for your future meetings. \\n\\n**Proxies *or* ballots?

Owners that don’t understand what they’re voting for will choose to abstain (or not vote at all) -- a serious problem when every vote counts.\\n\\n## Tip #2 - Provide a one-page cheat sheet for owners\\nWe’ve seen Proposed General Operating Bylaws that span 50+ pages of complex legalese and financial numbers. The average owner will not even attempt to get past the first few pages. A simple one page summary outlining the amendments will help owners understand what they are voting for.\\n\\n## Tip #3 - Try to only pass one bylaw per meeting\\nIn our experience, condos that attempt to pass more than one bylaw at a meeting tend to be unsuccessful at passing either one. Conversely, Condos that attempt to pass one bylaw per meeting are more successful at passing it.  Why? Trying to understand the impact of changing one bylaw may already be a lot to grasp for the average owner. Trying to pass two or more bylaws is likely to lead to more overwhelmed and frustrated owners who are unable to understand what’s happening.  Frustrated owners tend to vote unfavourably, or just won’t vote at all.\\n\\nIf there is a pressing need to pass more than one bylaw, group the bylaws together thematically to cover similar condo business. Combining related bylaws together will help simplify the messaging when communicating with owners and make it easier to highlight the benefits of the amendments. And the next tip becomes even more critical.\\n\\n## Tip #4 - Start educating your owners early - months in advance\\nIf you know that you have a bylaw to pass, start informing owners about it as soon as possible. You want a good few months. Chances are owners are going to have questions, and lots of them. Providing ample notice will provide condos with an opportunity to fully engage owners through educational emails, Q&A sessions, town-hall informational meetings, and more. Not only do you need to convince owners to vote, you’ll need to convince them to vote “yes”.\\n\\n## Tip #5 - Engage your owners regularly\\nIn one of the most [successful bylaw campaigns we were involved with](/stories/the-morgan-sub), our client sent weekly bylaw Q&A emails to owners over the course of two months. Residents were given the opportunity to submit their questions either by email or drop off their questions with the concierge and property manager.  The bylaw Q&As were posted in the lobby, elevator, distributed electronically, and were included as part of the mailed package.  The Q&A approach culminated into an informational town-hall meeting attended by owners,  the Corporation’s lawyer, and the condo insurance agent. By opening up the lines of communication and engaging with owners in a meaningful discussion, this condo was able to minimize the number of unfavourable votes (and, of course, maximize favourable votes), thus allowing them to easily pass their Standard Unit Bylaw.\\n\\n## Tip #6 - Keep your owners email list up to date\\nUnsurprisingly, condos that have a more complete and accurate list of their owner email addresses tend to be more successful at passing bylaws. Such condos are able to get the bylaw messaging out to a greater number of owners and, using GetQuorum’s proxy software, significantly increase the number of online proxies collected from owners.\\n\\n## Tip #7 - Be prepared to adjourn the meeting and try again later\\nDespite your best attempts, sometimes it takes more than one meeting to pass a bylaw. A number of our clients have successfully adjourned their meetings, collected additional online proxies to reach majority, then re-held the meeting to confirm the bylaw. Speak to your corporation’s solicitor about the proper way to adjourn the meeting and retain the existing votes.\\n\\n## Remember that every vote counts -- treat it like a political campaign\\nIf there’s one takeaway from this post, it’s that owners who do not feel educated enough to make an informed decision will simply choose not to vote, or will abstain and defer to their neighbours to make a decision for them.  The idea of “passing the buck” to better informed community members may be a reasonable justification.  However, “abstaining votes” can throw a serious wrench into a bylaw campaign since bylaws cannot be passed based on turnout alone.  A bylaw can only be approved when more than 50% of owners vote in favour of such bylaw.

Val recently took over as the new PM at The Fountains, a 500 unit condominium complex in the GTA. The Fountains has been trying to pass a Standard Unit By-law and Insurance Deductible By-law ever since it turned over, they finally passed both by-laws on Val’s watch. \\n\\nWith over three years of experience in the condominium management industry, Val will shed some light on how he got started as a PM and gives advice to Managers and Directors on how to pass their bylaws.  \\n \\n\\n**Q.** ***How long have you been a property manager? Why and how did you get into this industry?***\\n \\n**A.** I have been in the condominium management industry for just over three years now. I initially wanted to become a lawyer, but due to the high cost of the education I found another calling through the condominium industry. With a background in legal services, serving residents as my clients has always been a top priority.  \\n \\n**Q.** ***You recently became the property manager at The Fountains, can you tell us how that came about?***\\n \\n**A.** It is a funny story of how I ended up as the property manager for The Fountains. A year ago I attended an event in the party room at the Fountains.  Just before leaving the event, I mentioned in passing to the host about how great it would be to work here someday. Duka acquired the Fountains as a client a few years back, and surprisingly a year later I was lucky enough to take over from my colleagues.  \\n \\n**Q.**     ***What were some of the challenges taking over as the new property manager? How did you quickly build relationships with your owners?***\\n\\n**A.** I think the transition process went quite smoothly as we took on in-progress and outstanding items from my colleagues. Boards always have a bit of worry when a new PM comes on, even if it's within the same company, and we had a brand new team taking over the office too. It's the fear of the unknown and it's only natural. Regardless, all condos face the same key issues - controlling costs, proper maintenance, and contract negotiations. By reiterating our focus on these crucial matters, we secured the foundation to establishing trust and building relationships with the board and owners. \\n \\n**Q.**     ***Your corporation has been trying to pass two by-laws for the last few years, can you tell us a bit about them? Why did The Fountains need them to be passed?***\\n\\n**A.** The Corporation has been trying to pass a Standard Unit Bylaw and an Insurance Deductible Bylaw since the condominium’s turnover. The lack of a definition for the Standard Unit meant that the Corporation has been paying for repairs for the improvements and betterments in units due to water damage.  The absence of an Insurance Deductible Bylaw also brought additional costs for repairs to the common elements.  Fortunately, we don't have many of these events, but it only takes one or two in a period of time to drive up costs. Unfortunately, many of the owners did not realize the importance of these two bylaws until they saw sharp increases in their maintenance fees. If the bylaws didn’t get passed, the costs for the repairs and increases to the insurance premiums as a result of water damage would eventually become unsustainable for the Corporation and its owners.   \\n \\n**Q.**     ***What were some of the challenges the Corporation was facing in trying to pass the bylaws?***\\n \\n**A.** The biggest challenge for us was having over 70% of owners being offsite. Typically speaking, offsite owners aren’t always as involved in the governance of their condo, and as such aren’t as fully aware of the impact that the water damaged units and common elements were having on the Corporation’s bottom line. Whereas the onsite owners were very involved and responded positively to passing the bylaws, it was going to be an uphill battle to onboard as many offsite owners as possible to help.  We knew that collecting proxies alone would not guarantee that the bylaws would pass, if owners didn’t understand the fundamental reasons why the by-laws were needed, they would likely vote “No” on the by-laws, and that’d be bad for the condo’s future health. Our office acknowledged the fact that we would have to do more than just issue meeting notices and the meeting package, we’d have to work extra hard to get in touch with off-site owners and get them educated and voting.  \\n \\n**Q.**     ***How were you able to finally get the by-laws passed? What three key points would you give to another property manager facing the challenge of passing a bylaw?***\\n \\n**A.** We decided that we needed to pass these bylaws once and for all, and to do that we needed to educate and communicate with as many owners as possible.  We used GetQuorum to collect proxies electronically and that helped us immensely in being getting people engaged, especially from those off-site owners.  We got a lot of proxies upfront - around 40% - from the on-site and off-site owners that were more responsive (ie. the more involved ones).  But the last 10% was the hard part - getting the owners that don’t usually participate *to participate*.  And that took a concerted effort from our office - putting in extra hours through holding one-on-one meetings with individual owners after 5:00 pm to explain the importance of having the by-laws in place. We used every opportunity to introduce the bylaws and present the benefits; whether it was an arrears collection call or when the owner just dropped by to request a key/fob, we’d make sure to talk to them about the by-laws.\\n \\nI would recommend the following tips in passing the by-laws:\\n \\n1.       Be transparent and use regular language when explaining the cost and benefits of the bylaws. You will find that owners have questions or misconceptions about the by-laws that they won’t voice until you speak to them. The last thing you want to do is have owners vote with incorrect assumptions, because then you need to get extra votes to make up for their “No” vote. For every “No” vote, you need two “Yes” votes to make up for it.\\n\\n2.       Use every opportunity (call/email/meet in person) to explain the by-laws. Work with the Board of Directors and especially your office administrator, if one is present on site to talk about the bylaws in their interactions with owners.\\n\\n3.       Use an electronic proxy system. It makes it much easier for owners to complete their vote and shows you exactly who hasn’t completed a proxy yet so you can reach out to them. This helps you focus your efforts on a smaller number of owners so you don’t have to worry about reaching out to everyone. Having this data on hand is a must.\\n    \\n**Q.**    ***They say hindsight is 20/20, so what would you do differently if you could start the whole by-law process again?***\\n \\n**A.** I trusted the process and it did not lead us astray. The only thing I would do differently is to host an extra information session about the bylaws, and allow extra time for owners to submit their proxies.  The more time you spend educating your owners and generating awareness about the bylaws before starting to collect votes, the more likely those owners will choose “Yes” when voting begins.\\n\\n**Q.**    ***If other Property Managers and Board Directors have questions about the process of getting their by-laws passed, would you be open to chatting with them?***\\n\\n**A.**    Sure thing, I'd be happy for them to [email](mailto:volokhomenko@gmail.com) me. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nWould you or anyone you know like to be featured in our next Spotlight Series?

Our take on these articles and the issue of systemic proxy fraud in [this blog post](https://getquorum.com/blog/condo-board-battles-and-systemic-proxy-fraud/).\\n\\nSo, why are paper proxies so easy to defraud?\\n\\n\\n**Condo Owners don't know their rights**\\n\\nMany condo owners do not understand the proxy process.  So when a person comes knocking on the door requesting their vote, some may not check the identity of the person going door-to-door,  understand what they are signing, or simply handover incomplete proxies because they are unaware that this violates the Condo Act.  \\n\\n**Tampering and forgery**\\n\\nWhen an owner hands over their paper proxy to a proxy holder, the holder has the ability to change the vote or forge their signature on paper. Forged proxies were at the centre of the [condo battle controversy](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/condo-boards-toronto-1.4113053) when three men and their associates took aggressive steps to get on boards of several downtown condos.  Several owners at one of the condos in question have provided sworn affidavits to the police that their signatures were forged on their proxies, and the property management firm at a second condo corporation found a mismatch between the signatures on the proxies and what they had on file.\\n\\n**Lack of validation measures**\\n\\nThe only reliable way to verify intent would be for the chairperson to contact the each owner at the time of proxy registration before a meeting, but that’s not a feasible process when there are hundreds or even thousands of proxies that need to be verified.  Proxies presented at meetings would be taken at face value by the chairperson and the scrutineers, and the results of the election would then be entered into the meeting minutes.  \\n\\nThe startling examples of proxy fraud seen in the condo battle controversy reinforce the need for a more secure proxy.  Online proxies have several security mechanisms in place to ensure voting intent and protect against fraud.  \\n\\n## How does GetQuorum's Electronic Proxy System protect against fraud?\\n<br>\\n\\n**It reliably identifies the condo owner assigning the proxy**\\n\\nEnsuring voting intent through reliable security is important to us. GetQuorum provides unique encrypted tokens to each owner via email.  Owners enter the platform using their encrypted token via a unique link which ensures reliable identification before they can complete their proxy. Owners that require access to the platform can make a request through their property mangement to receive their unique token.  (Want to learn more or just chat about encryption and security [contact us](https://getquorum.com/contact/)). \\n\\n**It verifies the condo owner's voting intentions**\\n\\nWhen an owner goes through the proxy submission process on the GetQuorum platform they are provided with various confirmation dialogs to confirm their intent to vote a certain way through a review screen before submission and a copy of a receipt of the proxy for verification through email.  GetQuorum also allows owners the ability to change their mind about their submission by simply logging back onto the platform using the secure token provided to submit a new proxy.\\n\\n**The proxies are easily auditable**\\n\\nProxies must be retained for at least 90 days after an AGM or a requisitioned meeting in the event that someone contests their validity.  At one of the condos where one of the men had produced ninety fraudulent proxies, residents demanded an audit.  They were later informed that many of the proxies had been destroyed in a flood.  The few proxies that were recovered displayed irregularities.  \\n> “In one case, a condo owner who had died years earlier was supposedly able to sign a proxy ballot. Other residents claim their signatures were forged.” - [CBCNews](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/element-condo-perfect-clarity-1.4116032) (May 16, 2017)      \\n\\nElectronic proxies are stored digitally and cannot be doctored because of the cryptographic hashes used to ensure file integrity.  In the case where there is a challenge of the election results after a meeting, electronic proxies are auditable and can be easily produced when requested. \\n\\n**We are an independent party**\\n\\nIn politically charged environments, the benefits of having an unbiased third party means that no undue influence can be exerted by condo management or the Board.

At the end of the\nday, the board and the property manager of each individual corporation\nunderstands the personal dynamics and needs of their condo corporation better\nthan anyone.\n\nOther stuff:\nGetQuorum in the news: GetQuorum Co-Founder, Trevor Zeyl, is featured in\nCondominium Manager magazine discussing Electronic Voting & Proxies. Here's a\nlink to the article\n[http://acmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Electronic-Voting-Proxies-The-different-ways-to-cast-a-vote-and-what-condos-should-be-aware-of_W18.pdf]\n.\n\nGetQuorum at CAI Conference: GetQuorum will be hosting a booth at the CAI\nConference on February 7th, 2019. As well, I will be speaking on a panel session\non \"Condo Corporation Voting: Evolving Trends & New Technology\n[https://caicanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cai-agenda-final-1.1.png]\".

When a condo has well over 500 units, collecting information from owners can seem like an extremely daunting challenge. Nonetheless, the importance of keeping track of owner information using a database cannot be stressed enough. Utilizing our experience from working with hundreds of condo corporations of various sizes, we have summarized a set of tips below that can be used to successfully create an owner database.\\n\\n1. Create a Master Spreadsheet\\n2. Create and Distribute an Intake/Registration Form \\n3. Call Owners/Go Door-to-Door\\n4. Incentivize Owners\\n5. Use Condo Management Software\\n\\n\\n#### Tip #1: Create a Master Spreadsheet\\n\\nMicrosoft Excel is an amazing tool with countless benefits—one of which is its ability to make the tracking and organizing of information extremely simple. All you need to do is create the necessary headers, such as “name,” “suite number,” and “e-mail,” and insert the corresponding information under each header. Making changes in an Excel file is just as simple, so updating information when a current owner leaves or when a new owner enters can be done with ease. With Excel, you can also share your files with other staff members or third parties easily—just save the file, attach it to your e-mail message, and send it. It’s as simple as that.  \\n\\n#### Tip #2: Create and Distribute an Intake/Registration Form\\n\\nCreating an intake or registration form and distributing it to owners is a great method to obtain information. Such forms should include basic questions regarding the owner’s name, suite number, mailing address, and the like. Have owners either return the form to your front office or scan a copy back to you.

A great example of this is the use of gift cards—whenever an owner provides you with their information, you can provide them with a small gift card in return (we noticed that a $5 gift card to a coffee shop is the most common).

Just meeting this minimum can be difficult for some corporations. So imagine having to pass a bylaw where not only does quorum need to be reached, but a majority of the total unit owners (more than 50%) must vote in favour of the bylaw for it to pass. This higher voting threshold is what traditionally makes passing bylaws so difficult, especially for condos that already struggle to reach quorum.\\n\\nMany proposed or amended bylaws fail because a majority of owners simply choose not to cast their votes. Providing an online solution like electronic proxy voting can increase overall representation, which is particularly beneficial in buildings that have had difficulty with owner engagement. If an owner cannot physically attend the bylaw meeting then they have the option to submit a proxy form. Using an online proxy tool alleviates the inconvenience of trying to submit a traditional paper proxy which can include personally delivering, mailing, scanning and emailing, faxing, and in some cases photographing a physical copy to the property manager or condo Board. The usage of electronic proxies could relieve this pain point by providing a guided, elegant and convenient system for owners to easily submit their proxies.\\n\\nHowever, the ease of using this tool does not mean that it is a quick fix to pass all of the bylaws you have sitting on the back burner. It’s important to keep the owner in mind when bylaws become agenda items at AGMs. Boards need to take a step back and see things from the owners’ perspective — this might be their first time dealing with one bylaw let alone multiple bylaws that cover different facets of condo business. We have worked on several bylaw campaigns and have learned a lot from these collaborations with our partners. We wanted to share some of our experiences with you to help make your next future bylaw meeting a success.\\n\\n## Don’t try to pass too many bylaws at once, but if you do then make it thematic.\\n\\nWe recommend that Boards try to keep agendas short by limiting one bylaw per meeting. If you have a number of bylaws that you need to pass take the time to rank their importance and formulate a strategy for rolling them out over a period of a time (eg. over several AGMs). We totally get the fantasy of having an efficient meeting where five bylaws and two elections could be passed at once, but in our experience meetings like these tend to be unsuccessful because the average owner becomes overwhelmed and frustrated. We are condo directors too, and we understand that boards are trying to be more efficient with limited funds, but the funds become wasted if the meetings are unsuccessful.\\n\\nHowever, if there is a pressing need to pass more than one bylaw then group them together so that they cover similar condo business. When it comes to a communication strategy, focusing on one core issue surrounding one or more bylaws is much easier to get across than unrelated bylaws. Owners are more likely to relate to these changes in the bylaws if you can effectively shine a spotlight on the shared benefits of the proposed bylaws. For example, clearly outlining the potential cost savings to the corporation with a standard unit bylaw and insurance deductible in the case of a water damage will make it easier for owners to understand the importance of passing these bylaws.\\n\\n## Bylaws should be translated into clear and concise language that anyone can understand\\n\\nOwners are asked to read the bylaw documentation, which is often drafted by the Corporation’s lawyers. We understand that legal wording in the documents gives precision. But, it is a lot to ask for the average owner to take in at once. We have seen General Operating Bylaws that span 50 pages of complex legalese and financial numbers — the average person will not even attempt to read this. Bylaws should be translated and summarized into clear and concise language that anyone can understand. If your condo needs the authority to borrow funds in the case of a burst pipe in a common area — then say it.\\n\\n> TIP — Include a one page letter in the AGM package summarizing the reasons why the Corporation needs to pass the bylaw, how it will benefit the owners, and what could happen should the bylaw not be passed.\\n\\nIt is in a condo corporation’s favor to explain to owners and property management staff “why” the bylaw is needed. We have witnessed firsthand owners who refused to cast a vote because their Board and property manager could not properly articulate why they needed to amend a standard unit bylaw. Owners do not mean to be difficult, rather they do not want to vote for or against something they do not understand. So it is important that when you distribute bylaw meeting materials that you translate the legalese using common language that anyone can understand.\\n\\n> TIP — Summarize it to an elevator pitch\\n\\nWrite a short pitch that encompasses the reasons why the owner should vote in favour of the bylaw. Write it as though you were in an elevator with an owner and only had the span of the elevator ride to convince them.\\n\\nWe have also learned that owners who do not feel educated enough to make an informed decision will choose to abstain and defer to their neighbours to make a decision for them. The idea of “passing the buck” to better informed community members is a reasonable justification. However these abstaining votes can throw a serious wrench in a bylaw campaign, since condo bylaws cannot be passed based on turnout alone. Bylaws can only be approved when more than 50% of owners vote in favour, so for a community with 500 suites this means that 251 owners must cast an “in favour” vote.\\n\\n## Getting the message out there\\n\\nLeaving the notice package by the door or sending it by mail does not necessarily mean that owners have read it. Using electronic tools, such as free email marketing services and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, you can track if your communications are being read. These online tools can provide a more efficient way of keeping owners informed, and remind your community about upcoming elections and bylaw changes.\\n\\nMarketing theory teaches us that you have eight seconds to capture the attention of a reader, so it is crucial to include your “call to action” in the first couple of sentences of your newsletter or email. This “call to action” could range from letting your community know of their right to vote to informing them of the financial impacts of the bylaw. We have seen significant upticks in engagement during our email campaigns when the approach becomes educational. Notifying community members of the hard costs that go into meetings, what quorum means, or the consequences of not passing a bylaw can be an eye-opening experience.

We wanted to\nshare some of our experiences with you to help make your next future bylaw\nmeeting a success.\n\nDon’t try to pass too many bylaws at once, but if you do then make it thematic.\nWe recommend that Boards try to keep agendas short by limiting one bylaw per\nmeeting. If you have a number of bylaws that you need to pass take the time to\nrank their importance and formulate a strategy for rolling them out over a\nperiod of a time (eg. over several AGMs). We totally get the fantasy of having\nan efficient meeting where five bylaws and two elections could be passed at\nonce, but in our experience meetings like these tend to be unsuccessful because\nthe average owner becomes overwhelmed and frustrated. We are condo directors\ntoo, and we understand that boards are trying to be more efficient with limited\nfunds, but the funds become wasted if the meetings are unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, if there is a pressing need to pass more than one bylaw then group them\ntogether so that they cover similar condo business. When it comes to a\ncommunication strategy, focusing on one core issue surrounding one or more\nbylaws is much easier to get across than unrelated bylaws. Owners are more\nlikely to relate to these changes in the bylaws if you can effectively shine a\nspotlight on the shared benefits of the proposed bylaws. For example, clearly\noutlining the potential cost savings to the corporation with a standard unit\nbylaw and insurance deductible in the case of a water damage will make it easier\nfor owners to understand the importance of passing these bylaws.\n\nBylaws should be translated into clear and concise language that anyone can\nunderstand\nOwners are asked to read the bylaw documentation, which is often drafted by the\nCorporation’s lawyers. We understand that legal wording in the documents gives\nprecision. But, it is a lot to ask for the average owner to take in at once. We\nhave seen General Operating Bylaws that span 50 pages of complex legalese and\nfinancial numbers — the average person will not even attempt to read this.\nBylaws should be translated and summarized into clear and concise language that\nanyone can understand. If your condo needs the authority to borrow funds in the\ncase of a burst pipe in a common area — then say it.\n\n> TIP — Include a one page letter in the AGM package summarizing the reasons why\nthe Corporation needs to pass the bylaw, how it will benefit the owners, and\nwhat could happen should the bylaw not be passed.\n\n\nIt is in a condo corporation’s favor to explain to owners and property\nmanagement staff “why” the bylaw is needed. We have witnessed firsthand owners\nwho refused to cast a vote because their Board and property manager could not\nproperly articulate why they needed to amend a standard unit bylaw. Owners do\nnot mean to be difficult, rather they do not want to vote for or against\nsomething they do not understand. So it is important that when you distribute\nbylaw meeting materials that you translate the legalese using common language\nthat anyone can understand.\n\n> TIP — Summarize it to an elevator pitch\n\n\nWrite a short pitch that encompasses the reasons why the owner should vote in\nfavour of the bylaw. Write it as though you were in an elevator with an owner\nand only had the span of the elevator ride to convince them.\n\nWe have also learned that owners who do not feel educated enough to make an\ninformed decision will choose to abstain and defer to their neighbours to make a\ndecision for them. The idea of “passing the buck” to better informed community\nmembers is a reasonable justification. However these abstaining votes can throw\na serious wrench in a bylaw campaign, since condo bylaws cannot be passed based\non turnout alone. Bylaws can only be approved when more than 50% of owners vote\nin favour, so for a community with 500 suites this means that 251 owners must\ncast an “in favour” vote.\n\nGetting the message out there\nLeaving the notice package by the door or sending it by mail does not\nnecessarily mean that owners have read it. Using electronic tools, such as free\nemail marketing services and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software,\nyou can track if your communications are being read. These online tools can\nprovide a more efficient way of keeping owners informed, and remind your\ncommunity about upcoming elections and bylaw changes.\n\nMarketing theory teaches us that you have eight seconds to capture the attention\nof a reader, so it is crucial to include your “call to action” in the first\ncouple of sentences of your newsletter or email. This “call to action” could\nrange from letting your community know of their right to vote to informing them\nof the financial impacts of the bylaw. We have seen significant upticks in\nengagement during our email campaigns when the approach becomes educational.\nNotifying community members of the hard costs that go into meetings, what quorum\nmeans, or the consequences of not passing a bylaw can be an eye-opening\nexperience. Getting a better understanding of what is involved in running a\ncondo corporation will not only engage owners, but also provide more\nappreciation that their vote counts.\n\nHigher voting thresholds are what traditionally make bylaws so difficult to pass\nin condos. Condo Boards and their property management team have a number of\ntools at their disposal to increase overall owner representation. From email\nmarketing software, electronic proxy platform, social media and the condo\nwebsite — any one or a combination of these tools can engage owners when\ncomplemented with educational campaign on the importance of passing the proposed\nbylaws. So the next time a bylaw becomes an agenda item at your upcoming AGM\nit’s important to keep the owner in mind.","feature_image":"https://d1v53h6w11vaa4.cloudfront.net/blog/post1.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5ca1773605a0fd0026af827a","created_at":"2017-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T03:29:59.000Z","published_at":"2016-06-12T06:59:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca1773705a0fd0026af82b2","uuid":"fce013f5-46a7-4fd4-9fe2-d4a4bc819f45","title":"The \"Proxy Holder Discretionary Voting\" Debate","slug":"the-proxy-holder-discretionary-voting-debate","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"**_Update - May, 10 2018: The changes to the proxy form have addressed some of the concerns in this post.

Now there is a new debate brewing over whether a proxy holder can vote at their own discretion if the proxy giver does not provide explicit instructions.\\n\\n#### What’s all the controversy about? \\n\\nWell it all boils down to the first box on Page 2 of the prescribed proxy form which provides the owners two options. \\n\\n![](https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2018/03/proxy1-1.jpg)\\n\\nThe first option gives authority to the proxy holder to only vote on matters of routine procedure and nothing else.

We just make it super easy for owners to complete their proxy, it is up to you to decide whether to give proxy holder ballots or not. We see both sides to the argument, but we can all agree that ambiguity is bad for everyone, especially the owner.  \\n\\n#### Ambiguity is bad for everyone\\n\\nWhen a proxy is submitted, the Meeting Chair needs to be able to definitively understand the owner’s intentions. Consider the situation in which there are two director positions up for election. If the owner filled in one candidate’s name but left the other blank, does that mean they have decided to only choose one director, but not the other?

If a proxy holder is allowed to vote on all matters, then the corporation can use these unfilled proxies to their advantage when it comes to making decisions that benefit the corporation, like voting for a director that more aligns with their views (which can open up more opportunities for fraud). If the amendments to the Condo Act were meant to improve consumer protection, then providing a condo corporation the advantage flies in the face of that purpose.   \\n\\n#### A Rude Awakening for Owners\\n\\nMost owners don’t understand the importance of attending their AGM let alone the intricacies on how to complete a proxy form properly. So it would be reasonable to conclude that owners wouldn’t know that the consequences of leaving a proxy with blank fields will allow the proxy holder the ability to vote on all matters (not stated anywhere on the proxy form). \\n\\n#### An Experiment\\n\\nGetQuorum is fortunate to be located in a co-working space for other legal technology companies. We asked a small sampling (approximately 10) of our colleagues to complete the prescribed proxy, many of whom have never seen it before. After completing the form, we asked if their interpretation of the proxy form allowed the proxy holder to vote in their discretion if the instructions were left blank. 8 out of 10 said “no”. This is far from a scientific study, we wholey acknowledge that this doesn’t prove anything. \\n\\nActually it does, all 10 told us how ridiculously complicated the proxy was to complete, it also proves that you can get someone to complete the proxy by offering them a free coffee.\\n\\n### So what can we do?\\n\\nProxies are not a novel tool as they have been used in the corporate sector for decades.

The meeting is used to [conduct business that requires owners to vote](http://www.condoinformation.ca/owners-meetings-voting), such as the election new directors or on the amendment of by-laws. It's similar in nature to the AGM's held by publicly traded for-profit corporations.\\n\\nThese meetings require \\\"quorum\\\", a minimum number of members to be represented, in order to be considered valid. In condo terms, members are the owners of the units, and quorum is (at minimum) 25% of the total units in the condo. Unit owners can either attend the meeting in person or be represented \\\"by proxy\\\", which is a third party given the power to represent the owner through a legal form. A Proxy is obligated to vote according to the owner's wishes.\\n\\n## Many condos struggle to reach quorum\\n\\nWhy is that? Well, it's complicated.\\n\\nBut there's often a combination of there being a significant effort and/or substantial inconvenience for owners to attend a meeting or submit a proxy form. Or, do anything for that matter. The condo industry has a term for this...\\n\\n\\\"Owner Apathy\\\"\\n\\nWe can't blame owners though, life is too busy to worry about boring meetings and legal forms. But the consequences of failing to reach quorum are not good...\\n\\n### So what if quorum's not reached?\\nThe meeting must be adjourned and rescheduled for a later date. Having to adjourn and reschedule an in-progress meeting is a huge waste of time and money. This is especially true for condos that lack the facilities to hold meetings on site. There are also costs related to the AGM informational package (printing and postage), auditor attendance, minute takers, and more -- all of which have to be done again for the rescheduled meeting.\\n\\nIn our client's case, it's upwards of $2500 in hard costs **per meeting**.\\n\\nThe challenge for corporations is that they won't know if quorum will be reached until the meeting commences. There's no way to plan for failure...\\n\\n### How do condos typically deal with this problem?\\n\\nCondos usually provide a templated proxy form to owners who are encouraged to fill it out and submit it to the management office prior to the meeting. But getting owners to complete the required action is easier said than done.

I agree, to most owners the inner workings of a condo (how it is governed) is neither properly understood or an area of particular interest.

So, why then was I apathetic prior to the disastrous Kitec removal project?  After all, my condo was the largest investment I'd ever made.  My presumption, as a average owner, was that paying condo fees absolved me of any additional financial liabilities.  As well, I presumed that no one could tell me what to do in my own unit.  A combination of too busy, uninformed and uninterested.  Oh how wrong I was...\\n\\n> \\\"**If you don't like it, move out**\\\" was what the Judge said to us.\\n\\nDuring our mediation, the Judge commented that as owners in a condo, we forfeit certain decision making rights and privileges.  \\\"If you don't like it, move out\\\" was what the Judge said to us.  \\\"Sell and get out\\\" is the advice of Holland Marshall of [www.condomadness.info](http://www.condomadnes.info).  Both are harsh but true, in my opinion.  Unfortunately, most owners learn this lesson after it is too late.  [Megan Mackey from Shibley Righton](http://www.shibleyrighton.com/Lawyers/Lawyers_List/~534_Megan%20Mackey) describes the main difference between condo and freehold ownership as \\\"decision making\\\".  Based on my experience, many owners really, really did not like having someone else making a decision that would directly impact their suites (and wallets). Most had no idea that the Corporation could obligate and force an owner to do something. So, I wholeheartedly agree, condo owners generally lack the understanding of their rights and obligations, period.  I did too, until I had no choice but to learn it.\\n\\n###The Role of the Board & Property Management\\nBecoming a Board member was also an eye opening experience.  Learning the role of the Board, the Property Manager and how to govern in compliance with the Condo Act was all new to me.  After approximately 4 years, I can confidently concur with [Audrey McGuire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-mcguire-15011415b/), the horsepower of a property management firm was massively beneficial to our corporation.  Whether it was using financial models and best practices for budgeting, leveraging tender processes and curated vendor lists or the fully staffed back office accounting services, our Management firm made our role as Directors easier.  Property Management presented the Board with options, often times the choice was clear.  We directed the corporation in accordance with the Act and based on our philosophy of protecting the value of our property.\\n\\nLastly, I found that the Board's role is a balance between risk mitigation, financial management and, unfortunately, dealing with conflict arising between owners and/or the corporation.  For the most part, financial issues and risk mitigation were pretty straight forward.  A good Board will seek out and act upon the advice of professionals (e.g. lawyers, engineers), obtain multiple quotes, use proper contract tendering processes and adhere to accounting standards.  When it comes to handling conflict, whether it is between owners or with the corporation itself, the Board is to follow and enforce the Condo Act, the declaration, bylaws and rules of the corporation regardless of any personal sentiment towards an owner.   Of course, there were times when we sided favorably with an Owner that chose to communicate with us in a less-than-courteous manner... but that is part of being on the Board (and a PM).    \\n\\nSo, are Ontario's condos well governed?

To be honest,\ncondo governance was a mystery to me until pipes in my condo started exploding!\n\nIt was not until my Condo Corporation took action to remove faulty Kitec piping\nthat I was forced to learn the basics of the Condo Act and about how a condo is\ngoverned. I'll spare you the gory details but they include an Application for\nCourt Order, a Requisitioned Owners Meeting, court ordered mediation, lots of\nproxies, a multi-million dollar plumbing project and, finally, getting\npersonally elected to my condo board.\n\nIn retrospect, I would describe myself as the average downtown Toronto\ncondo-owner, a real estate rookie. So, why then was I apathetic prior to the\ndisastrous Kitec removal project? After all, my condo was the largest investment\nI'd ever made. My presumption, as a average owner, was that paying condo fees\nabsolved me of any additional financial liabilities. As well, I presumed that no\none could tell me what to do in my own unit. A combination of too busy,\nuninformed and uninterested. Oh how wrong I was...\n\n> \"If you don't like it, move out\" was what the Judge said to us.\n\n\nDuring our mediation, the Judge commented that as owners in a condo, we forfeit\ncertain decision making rights and privileges. \"If you don't like it, move out\"\nwas what the Judge said to us. \"Sell and get out\" is the advice of Holland\nMarshall of www.condomadness.info [http://www.condomadnes.info]. Both are harsh\nbut true, in my opinion. Unfortunately, most owners learn this lesson after it\nis too late. Megan Mackey from Shibley Righton\n[http://www.shibleyrighton.com/Lawyers/Lawyers_List/~534_Megan%20Mackey] \ndescribes the main difference between condo and freehold ownership as \"decision\nmaking\". Based on my experience, many owners really, really did not like having\nsomeone else making a decision that would directly impact their suites (and\nwallets). Most had no idea that the Corporation could obligate and force an\nowner to do something. So, I wholeheartedly agree, condo owners generally lack\nthe understanding of their rights and obligations, period. I did too, until I\nhad no choice but to learn it.\n\nThe Role of the Board & Property Management\nBecoming a Board member was also an eye opening experience. Learning the role of\nthe Board, the Property Manager and how to govern in compliance with the Condo\nAct was all new to me. After approximately 4 years, I can confidently concur\nwith Audrey McGuire [https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-mcguire-15011415b/], the\nhorsepower of a property management firm was massively beneficial to our\ncorporation. Whether it was using financial models and best practices for\nbudgeting, leveraging tender processes and curated vendor lists or the fully\nstaffed back office accounting services, our Management firm made our role as\nDirectors easier. Property Management presented the Board with options, often\ntimes the choice was clear. We directed the corporation in accordance with the\nAct and based on our philosophy of protecting the value of our property.\n\nLastly, I found that the Board's role is a balance between risk mitigation,\nfinancial management and, unfortunately, dealing with conflict arising between\nowners and/or the corporation. For the most part, financial issues and risk\nmitigation were pretty straight forward. A good Board will seek out and act upon\nthe advice of professionals (e.g. lawyers, engineers), obtain multiple quotes,\nuse proper contract tendering processes and adhere to accounting standards. When\nit comes to handling conflict, whether it is between owners or with the\ncorporation itself, the Board is to follow and enforce the Condo Act, the\ndeclaration, bylaws and rules of the corporation regardless of any personal\nsentiment towards an owner. Of course, there were times when we sided favorably\nwith an Owner that chose to communicate with us in a less-than-courteous\nmanner... but that is part of being on the Board (and a PM).\n\nSo, are Ontario's condos well governed? I think they can be. However, a good\nBoard with solid and relevant professional skills is helpful. As well, an\nexperienced Property Manager and Management firm, with the 'horsepower' needed\nto support buildings with sophisticated needs, are critical.\n\nWant to keep the conversation going?

The updated proxy form addresses many of the concerns the condo industry had voiced after the amended Act came into force last November.  The updated proxy form has resolved some of the issues that we had raised - [making it easier for owners to complete](https://getquorum.com/blog/the-new-prescribed-proxy-form-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) and addressing some of the concerns about [proxy holder discretionary voting](https://getquorum.com/blog/the-proxy-holder-discretionary-voting-debate/).\\n\\nGetQuorum’s electronic proxy system is fully compliant with the updates to the Prescribed Proxy and has already been rolled out.\\n\\n### So what's changed? \\n\\nAside from a general reorganization of the form (ie. restructuring of certain sections and making the language clearer) the most substantial changes to the proxy form are as follows:\\n\\n1. An owner can now explicitly authorize their proxy holder to vote on matters at their own discretion; or\\n\\n2. An owner can completely restrict their proxy holder from voting on _anything_, even on matters of routine procedure.

This makes for a shorter and cleaner form in most cases. The changes are a welcome improvement, for the most part.  As previously mentioned the updated proxy form now solves some parts of the discretionary voting debate, but raises another dilemma.\\n\\n### There's no clear option for an owner to refuse to vote on a matter.\\n\\nAs we mentioned in one of our other blog posts, voters have a [legal right to abstain or refuse to cast a vote](https://getquorum.com/blog/the-new-prescribed-proxy-form-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/). Look at the following section from the proxy form in which an owner can elect directors.  How would you fill it out if you decide you don’t want a vote to be cast on this matter?\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align: center\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2018/05/blank_elections.png\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid gray\\\" />\\n<small><i>New general election section</i></small>\\n</div>\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nRemember that these forms are meant to be used by the general public, which includes people that may not have the experience to fully appreciate the nuances of completing these types of forms correctly. \\n\\n### The Experiment\\n\\nIn exchange for a free coffee we asked a sample of twenty people at our co-working space how they’d \\\"abstain\\\" from voting using the updated proxy forms.  \\n\\n- 65% said “don’t check the box”\\n- 25% said “check the box, leave it blank”\\n- 10% said “check the box, write in ‘I choose not to vote’”\\n\\nAll of the responses seem like reasonable interpretations at first glance, unfortunately the new language in the proxy form now states: \\n\\n>_“...if you do not provide instructions with respect to any part of the rest of this form, you are giving your proxy the authority to nominate any candidates or vote in any manner with respect to that part of the form..._”\\n\\nSo this means that the 65% of people above who didn’t check the box would now have their proxy holder cast a vote for them anyways. It could also be argued that the 25% who checked the box and left it blank could also have the proxy holder cast the vote for them. Only the last group of 10% would have their proxy correctly interpreted as not wanting their vote cast.\\n\\nOur experiment reveals a real problem - specifically that the form still leaves room for misinterpretation of the proxy form if the owner has not filled the section out explicitly.  If changes to the Act were meant to protect condo owners, then the forms provided to owners should contain clear instructions so that there is no room for confusion.  \\n\\n### What is GetQuorum doing to help?\\n\\nWe are big proponents of consumer protection and believe that the proxy form should capture the intent of the owner when voting. Here's how GetQuorum's electronic proxy system handles the updated requirements:\\n \\n1. Owners can choose to authorize their proxy to vote at their discretion on a matter; or\\n\\n2. Owners can choose to not vote and not allow their proxy to vote on a matter\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align: center\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2018/05/new_bylaw_opts-4.png\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid gray\\\" />\\n<small><i>Voting on a by-law using GetQuorum</i></small>\\n</div>\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nIn the case of an owner choosing not to cast their vote in the matters of electing directors, GetQuorum outputs a proxy form like this:\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align: center\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2018/05/output.png\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid gray\\\" />\\n<small><i>The owner’s intent is perfectly clear, there’s no ambiguity here</i></small>\\n</div>\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n### Where do we go now?\\n\\nThe Prescribed Proxy form was meant to be a catch-all for every possible permutation of a condo meeting.  But, in the attempt to be all things to every meeting type the Ministry had made an overly long and complicated form.  Though the updates to the form now addresses some of the issues that had been raised in the condo community, it’s still an imperfect instrument that still allows for misinterpretation of an owner’s voting intentions. Proxy form disputes can be a common occurrence when filled out by hand because of the ambiguity involved when filled out incorrectly.\\n\\nFortunately with a guided system like GetQuorum around, owners fill out their proxy perfectly each time. This gives our clients comfort in never having to worry about their owners' proxies and other irregularities.\\n\\n### Are electronic proxies the only way for owners to vote online? \\n\\nNo, in the Amended Act the Ministry now enables condos to permit their owners to vote through “telephonic or electronic means”. These additional ways to vote were part of the number of “mini bylaws” that the Ministry added to the Act to make it easier for corporations to enact more ways for their owners to participate in decision-making processes.  These “mini bylaws” can be passed with only a majority vote at a meeting - essentially over 12.5% of owners need to vote “Yes”.  \\n\\nTo enable the electronic balloting process, condo corporations will need to hold a bylaw meeting or add the bylaw as an agenda item for their next AGM.  Once the bylaw is passed, electronic balloting can be used for future meetings.\\n\\nDo you want to get electronic balloting setup in your corporation? We can help you pass the electronic voting bylaw using our electronic proxy system.  And once we help you pass your bylaw, GetQuorum’s balloting system is ready for your future meetings.  Our electronic balloting system has already been used successfully by our non-condo clients.  \\n\\nNeed more guidance on passing the electronic balloting mini bylaw?

The updated\nproxy form addresses many of the concerns the condo industry had voiced after\nthe amended Act came into force last November. The updated proxy form has\nresolved some of the issues that we had raised - making it easier for owners to\ncomplete\n[https://getquorum.com/blog/the-new-prescribed-proxy-form-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/] \n and addressing some of the concerns about proxy holder discretionary voting\n[https://getquorum.com/blog/the-proxy-holder-discretionary-voting-debate/].\n\nGetQuorum’s electronic proxy system is fully compliant with the updates to the\nPrescribed Proxy and has already been rolled out.\n\nSo what's changed?\nAside from a general reorganization of the form (ie. restructuring of certain\nsections and making the language clearer) the most substantial changes to the\nproxy form are as follows:\n\n 1. An owner can now explicitly authorize their proxy holder to vote on matters\n    at their own discretion; or\n    \n    \n 2. An owner can completely restrict their proxy holder from voting on anything,\n    even on matters of routine procedure. The proxy is just there to allow for\n    quorum.\n    \n    \n\nThe \"old\" prescribed proxy\nThe \"new\" prescribed proxy\nThis addresses some of the concerns we blogged about not too long ago regarding\nthe proxy being ambiguous when it comes to discretionary proxy voting\n[https://getquorum.com/blog/the-proxy-holder-discretionary-voting-debate/].\n\nThe rest of the form is substantially the same, just with sections moved around\nor hidden unless needed. This makes for a shorter and cleaner form in most\ncases. The changes are a welcome improvement, for the most part. As previously\nmentioned the updated proxy form now solves some parts of the discretionary\nvoting debate, but raises another dilemma.\n\nThere's no clear option for an owner to refuse to vote on a matter.\nAs we mentioned in one of our other blog posts, voters have a legal right to\nabstain or refuse to cast a vote\n[https://getquorum.com/blog/the-new-prescribed-proxy-form-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/]\n. Look at the following section from the proxy form in which an owner can elect\ndirectors. How would you fill it out if you decide you don’t want a vote to be\ncast on this matter?\n\nNew general election section\nRemember that these forms are meant to be used by the general public, which\nincludes people that may not have the experience to fully appreciate the nuances\nof completing these types of forms correctly.\n\nThe Experiment\nIn exchange for a free coffee we asked a sample of twenty people at our\nco-working space how they’d \"abstain\" from voting using the updated proxy forms.\n\n * 65% said “don’t check the box”\n * 25% said “check the box, leave it blank”\n * 10% said “check the box, write in ‘I choose not to vote’”\n\nAll of the responses seem like reasonable interpretations at first glance,\nunfortunately the new language in the proxy form now states:\n\n> “...if you do not provide instructions with respect to any part of the rest of\nthis form, you are giving your proxy the authority to nominate any candidates or\nvote in any manner with respect to that part of the form...”\n\n\nSo this means that the 65% of people above who didn’t check the box would now\nhave their proxy holder cast a vote for them anyways. It could also be argued\nthat the 25% who checked the box and left it blank could also have the proxy\nholder cast the vote for them. Only the last group of 10% would have their proxy\ncorrectly interpreted as not wanting their vote cast.\n\nOur experiment reveals a real problem - specifically that the form still leaves\nroom for misinterpretation of the proxy form if the owner has not filled the\nsection out explicitly. If changes to the Act were meant to protect condo\nowners, then the forms provided to owners should contain clear instructions so\nthat there is no room for confusion.\n\nWhat is GetQuorum doing to help?\nWe are big proponents of consumer protection and believe that the proxy form\nshould capture the intent of the owner when voting. Here's how GetQuorum's\nelectronic proxy system handles the updated requirements:\n\n 1. Owners can choose to authorize their proxy to vote at their discretion on a\n    matter; or\n    \n    \n 2. Owners can choose to not vote and not allow their proxy to vote on a matter\n    \n    \n\nVoting on a by-law using GetQuorum\nIn the case of an owner choosing not to cast their vote in the matters of\nelecting directors, GetQuorum outputs a proxy form like this:\n\nThe owner’s intent is perfectly clear, there’s no ambiguity here\nWhere do we go now?\nThe Prescribed Proxy form was meant to be a catch-all for every possible\npermutation of a condo meeting. But, in the attempt to be all things to every\nmeeting type the Ministry had made an overly long and complicated form. Though\nthe updates to the form now addresses some of the issues that had been raised in\nthe condo community, it’s still an imperfect instrument that still allows for\nmisinterpretation of an owner’s voting intentions.

This gives our clients comfort in never having to\nworry about their owners' proxies and other irregularities.\n\nAre electronic proxies the only way for owners to vote online?\nNo, in the Amended Act the Ministry now enables condos to permit their owners to\nvote through “telephonic or electronic means”. These additional ways to vote\nwere part of the number of “mini bylaws” that the Ministry added to the Act to\nmake it easier for corporations to enact more ways for their owners to\nparticipate in decision-making processes. These “mini bylaws” can be passed with\nonly a majority vote at a meeting - essentially over 12.5% of owners need to\nvote “Yes”.\n\nTo enable the electronic balloting process, condo corporations will need to hold\na bylaw meeting or add the bylaw as an agenda item for their next AGM.

The\nStandard Unit By-Law is one of the most difficult in the industry to pass - it’s\nrelatively easy for suite owners to grasp, but commonly misunderstood as being\npersonally detrimental (read our blog post about this topic\n[/blog/thoughts-passing-standard-unit-bylaws]).\n\nGetQuorum’s team collaborated with The Morgan’s Board of Directors and\nManagement to create a strategy to help pass the Standard Unit By-Law this\nautumn. During the campaign, owners were educated on the importance of the\nBy-Law with weekly FAQ and educational emails. By actively engaging owners, The\nMorgan was able to boost owner participation through electronic proxy\nsubmission.\n\nSo, how'd it go?\nSee for yourself...\n\nVotes required to pass bylaw:113\n Total online proxies received:120\n Percentage of units represented by online proxy:53%\n The 120 electronic proxies submitted by owners added to the 27 paper proxies\nthat The Morgan’s team was able to collect. With 11 owners having attended in\nperson, an astounding 70% of all units were represented at the meeting. The\neffectiveness of the educational campaign was evident in the 110 “in favor”\nvotes from the electronic proxy submissions. The Morgan’s success can be\nattributed to taking the time to explain how the By-Law would benefit the\nCorporation’s bottom line and ultimately the owners, engaging owners in\ndiscussion about the By-Law, and providing a convenient way for owners to submit\ntheir vote.\n\n> “We wanted to work with GetQuorum again after the surprising number of proxies\ntheir service was able to help us collect for our last AGM. The Standard Unit\nBy-Law is something we have been trying to implement for the past three years,\nand we became optimistic when GetQuorum’s team announced that they had helped\nother condominiums pass by-laws in the past, and outlined their owner engagement\nstrategy.\n\n\n> We were pleasantly surprised at how effective the engagement strategy was and\nhow many electronic proxies we were able to collect.

After all, we had specifically developed GetQuorum knowing that most condos have a difficult time convincing owners to attend meetings. These struggles can be attributed to a number of factors, including:\\n\\n1. Large numbers of owners may live off-site\\n2. That many condominium owners are busy and do not have the time to participate in owner meetings\\n3. A lack of understanding, on the part of owners, of their legal rights\\n4. The inconvenient and confusing nature of the current paper-based proxy system  \\n\\nWhat was unique about 50 Absolute, however, was that they had failed to achieve quorum in each of the past six years. Last year alone, 50 Absolute held two AGMs in an attempt to obtain quorum, however both came up short and only a few dozen unit owners attended in person with only a few paper proxies submitted.\\n\\nTo make matters even more challenging this year, 50 Absolute also needed to pass a [Standard Unit Bylaw](/blog/thoughts-passing-standard-unit-bylaws), which required approval from more than 50% of all unit owners. That said, GetQuorum never shies away from a challenge and happily accepted our new client and got to work.\\n\\nWe partnered with [DigiNotice](http://digi-notice.com/), digital signage providers for 50 Absolute and experts in condominium communications strategies, to develop a solicitation campaign. Our goal was to educate owners on the importance of meeting quorum, why the Standard Unit Bylaw was needed, and how the Standard Unit Bylaw would benefit their community and help protect their investments.\\n\\n![50 Absolute](https://d1v53h6w11vaa4.cloudfront.net/stories/50_abs_modified.jpg)\\n_<p align=\\\"center\\\"><sup>50 Absolute (pic courtesy of Peter Kudlacz - <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/peter-kudlacz/6022393881\\\">flickr.com</a>)</sup></p>_\\n\\n## Lots and Lots of Paper\\n\\nHaving never reached quorum, our client was required to approve six years of financial statements. **Their AGM meeting package contained over 130 pages**!

With a single ‘click’ on a mobile or desktop device, GetQuorum gathers owner consent (or “pre-consent”) for the electronic distribution of the AGM meeting package.\\n\\nWe typically obtain owner consent rates for online distribution from upwards of 65% of owners in any given condo, something that helps drastically reduce printing and mailing costs. Our pre-consent technology also helps condominium corporations and their property managers realize operational efficiencies - that is, it allows them to focus their energies on important projects rather than spend time and energy physically collecting and recording consent.\\n\\nWith the pre-consents we collected for 50 Absolute, were able to immediately save our clients over $3,400 in printing and mailing costs. The remaining owners that did not provide their pre-consent were mailed hard copies through GetQuorum’s printing and mailing service.\\n\\n## Educational Campaign and Solicitation of Proxies\\n\\nNow that the AGM package had been distributed, it was time to gather proxies and votes.

You can start with your property management office by collecting email addresses and having owners provide written consent to being served by email.\\n\\n### TIP #1 — Update your resident information & registration forms and ask for their email addresses. \\n\\nInclude a checkbox that allows owners to opt-in for electronic notice package delivery. You can then maintain a simple spreadsheet of the email addresses and the consent of unit owners.\\n\\n### TIP #2 — Use your condo’s website to have owners provide their consent and email addresses. \\n\\nIf you don’t have a condo website, create a simple Google Form to collect owner information.\\n\\n### Tip #3 — Use email marketing services or customer relationship management software to send notices to your owners. \\n\\nThere are plenty of free software available that can do this including Mailchimp and Hubspot. Or, better yet, use GetQuorum’s included online distribution system to serve notice of meetings to your owners.\\n\\n## Will owners consent?\\n\\nOne of the concerns that we have seen is the worry over having to convince a community to abandon traditional mail service, but we have seen that nearly 95% of GetQuorum users opt-in to receiving notice packages (and all other notices) by email.\\n\\nServing notice and distributing meeting packages electronically can be a more efficient way of keeping owners informed, reminding your community about upcoming meetings, and keeping your communication costs low.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Annual general meetings (AGMs) are held by condo corporations on a yearly basis to outline the past fiscal year’s affairs, election of new directors and any upcoming business.

The Ontario Condo Act provides guidelines on how to conduct,\nhold, and serve notice of these meetings.\nFor most condos, serving notice of the meeting makes up at least half of AGM\nexpenses — this is because notices are traditionally printed and mailed to\nowners. Notice packages typically include the meeting agenda, financial\nstatements, minutes of previous year’s meetings, director candidate resumes, and\ndetails of any proposed bylaws to be voted on. That’s a lot of pages to\nprint — indeed we’ve seen meeting packages that span 100 pages and up. For a\nlarge condo, say 500 units or more, at 100 pages per unit, that’s 50,000 pages.\nA ton of paper!\n\nWhy not just send it all by email?\nSimple question right?\n\nWe’re often asked if our included online package distribution service can be\nused in place of traditional print and postage. Yes, it can be, but only if the\nowner consents to being served notice packages by email. As per the Condo Act,\nmeeting packages can be served by “electronic mail or any other method of\nelectronic communication if the owner agrees in writing that the party giving\nthe notice may give the notice in this manner”. If consent is not given, then\nemail alone is not sufficient as a method to service notice, the package must\nstill be printed and sent via mail.\n\nSo, if it’s legal to do, then why don’t more condos send their meeting packages\nthrough email?\nWe’ve seen some common patterns:\n\n 1. Corporations don’t collect and record owners’ email addresses as a normal\n    procedure\n 2. Corporations don’t have express consent from owners to receive notices by\n    email\n 3. Corporations don’t have the tools to send electronic notices\n 4. Corporations don’t consider email addresses as part of owners’ contact\n    information\n\nSo how can you get your community on board for electronic communications?\nThere are a number of approaches to take when you are transitioning owners from\nserving notice by mail to email. You can start with your property management\noffice by collecting email addresses and having owners provide written consent\nto being served by email.\n\nTIP #1 — Update your resident information & registration forms and ask for their\nemail addresses.\nInclude a checkbox that allows owners to opt-in for electronic notice package\ndelivery. You can then maintain a simple spreadsheet of the email addresses and\nthe consent of unit owners.\n\nTIP #2 — Use your condo’s website to have owners provide their consent and email\naddresses.\nIf you don’t have a condo website, create a simple Google Form to collect owner\ninformation.\n\nTip #3 — Use email marketing services or customer relationship management\nsoftware to send notices to your owners.\nThere are plenty of free software available that can do this including Mailchimp\nand Hubspot. Or, better yet, use GetQuorum’s included online distribution system\nto serve notice of meetings to your owners.\n\nWill owners consent?\nOne of the concerns that we have seen is the worry over having to convince a\ncommunity to abandon traditional mail service, but we have seen that nearly 95%\nof GetQuorum users opt-in to receiving notice packages (and all other notices)\nby email.\n\nServing notice and distributing meeting packages electronically can be a more\nefficient way of keeping owners informed, reminding your community about\nupcoming meetings, and keeping your communication costs low.","feature_image":"https://d1v53h6w11vaa4.cloudfront.net/blog/post2.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5ca1773605a0fd0026af827a","created_at":"2017-01-17T07:56:49.000Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T05:32:33.000Z","published_at":"2016-08-03T06:56:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca1773705a0fd0026af82bb","uuid":"b1496cb1-40af-44b8-ac93-85bc70465c71","title":"Passing a Bylaw With The GetQuorum Platform - A Case Study","slug":"passing-a-bylaw-with-getquorum","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"We teamed up with Malvern Condominium Property Management to help one of their clients, a 290-unit condo in Toronto, pass a critical Borrowing Bylaw at a Special General Meeting.

First, there has been a wholesale change in the form of proxy that the Government of Ontario now requires that condos use (also known as the “prescribed form”). Second, the amendments now permit for the use of electronic balloting (provided that a condo corporation first passes a bylaw adopting its use). \\n\\nIn this post, we’ll discuss the differences between electronic proxies and electronic ballots, some of the concerns that condos need to be aware of regarding electronic balloting, and how to start using advance balloting in your owner meetings.\\n  \\n\\n## First, what's a proxy?\\nA proxy vote is a ballot cast by a person on behalf of a condo owner who is unable to attend a meeting. With a proxy, an owner appoints their proxy representative to vote in accordance with the instructions set out in the proxy form, or if the owner has not provided specific instructions, the proxyholder may vote in their discretion. The proxyholder could be anyone the owner chooses - a family member, the meeting chairperson, or the President of the Corporation, just to name a few.\\n\\nThis is different from ballot voting, whereby an owner directly casts their vote on meeting matters and, at least traditionally speaking, such ballot is cast at the meeting itself (and hence, there is no need to appoint a proxy).\\n\\n## What was all the hubub about proxies from before?\\nPrior to the advent of electronic proxies, \\\"proxy forms\\\" were submitted to the Corporation in paper format. There were many reported incidents of unscrupulous owners showing up to a meeting with a big stack of proxies and ultimately the power to elect any candidate for director that they wished. Because it was difficult to verify the legitimacy of paper proxies, these unscrupulous owners could abuse and defraud the system for their own personal gain. The proxies could very well have been legitimate, but they could have been collected through coercion or intimidation.\\n\\n**GetQuorum’s electronic proxy system has eliminated these issues**, our clients can rest easy because our guided tool makes completing proxies easy and accessible for owners. And, proxy fraud is never an issue because our system has security measures in place to prevent abuse (eg. unique access codes, IP address tracking and numerous encryption methods).\\n\\n## So what's the difference between advance electronic ballots and electronic proxies?\\n\\nNot much.\\n\\n**GetQuorum provides both advance electronic balloting and electronic proxies**. Both are ways for owners to conveniently and securely cast their votes online, and both follow the same basic workflow. However, there are some key differences between the two methods of voting:\\n\\n1. Proxies allow an owner to defer the vote to the proxy holder\\n2. Electronic balloting first requires the passing of bylaws, electronic proxies do not and can already be used \\n3. Votes by proxy can be revoked or changed by the owner at any time\\n4. Proxies are valid for a meeting's adjournments\\n\\n### Proxies allow an owner to defer the vote to the proxy holder\\n\\nThe recent changes to Ontario's prescribed proxy form in May 2018 now allow owners to defer their voting instructions to the discretion of the proxy holder. [Read our blog post about the new changes and how we handle deferral of votes](https://getquorum.com/blog/new-updates-to-ontarios-prescribed-proxy-form/). It turns out that a significant number of owners actually prefer to have their proxy holders vote on meeting items in their discretion, and we've seen an **increase in voter participation because of this change**.\\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nPrior to the May 2018 proxy changes, owners that weren't sure how to vote on a particular matter would either choose to abstain from the vote or not participate at all. These choices would end up being detrimental to the condo corporation, especially in cases where the condo corporation needed to pass a bylaw. But the new prescribed form of proxy added a new option: \\\"I give my proxy authority to make the decision\\\". This new choice provides owners with additional flexibility in circumstances where they are unsure how to vote as they can now defer this choice to someone whose judgement they trust. \\n\\n### Electronic balloting requires a special bylaw\\n\\nUnder the amended Act, a condo corporation can now permit “owners to cast a vote by “telephonic and electronic means” (i.e. electronic ballots) if it <u>first passes a bylaw</u> adopting its use. This “electronic voting bylaw\\\" must receive a simple majority of votes in order to pass (assuming quorum for the meeting is first reached). Once the bylaw is passed, electronic balloting can be used for future meetings. \\n\\n### Votes by proxy can be revoked or changed by the owner at any time\\n\\nAlthough electronic proxies and advance electronic ballots allow an owner to vote ahead of the meeting, the nature of proxy voting is such that no vote is cast until the meeting actually commences. So before a meeting takes place, an owner can choose to revoke their proxy and/or submit a new one. Whereas with an advance ballot, those votes may now be locked and unchangeable.\\n\\nConsider the following scenario: An owner is unavailable to attend the meeting so they cast an advance ballot ahead of time. On the day of the meeting they suddenly find themselves available to attend, so they do. If the owner voted by electronic proxy, they would be able to revoke the proxy and vote in person. If they voted by ballot, that vote may now be locked in. This inflexibility becomes more of an issue when an owner learns something new after submitting their ballot that would make them want to change their vote. Proxies provide the owner with more flexibility in this regard.\\n\\n\\n### Proxies are valid for a meeting's adjournments\\n\\nThe prescribed form of proxy specifies that the form is valid for a meeting and all it's adjournments. So if a meeting needs to be postponed, rescheduled, or adjourned, then all proxies collected for that meeting can still be used when it's reconvened. This can save considerable time and effort for the management team for the new meeting.\\n\\n\\n## So does that mean that owners can only cast their vote by proxy or ballot?\\n\\nNo, it doesn’t. \\n\\nThe Condo Act requires that proxies must still be a valid method for an owner to cast their vote. Proxies and ballots **can** and **should** be used together. \\n\\n>**GetQuorum allows the owner to decide if they would like to use electronic proxies or advance electronic ballots.** \\n\\nOur secure platform makes it easy for owners to cast their vote so that they can take part in the decision-making processes for their condo.  We just make it super easy for owners to complete their electronic proxy or ballot. \\n\\nAnd don’t let the passing of the mini bylaw get you down. Historically speaking, clients that use the GetQuorum platform have achieved quorum on the first try. We can help you pass the voting bylaw using our electronic proxy system. And once we help you pass your bylaw, GetQuorum’s balloting system is ready for your future meetings. Our electronic balloting system has already been used successfully by our non-condo clients.\\n\\n## Are there any issues to consider when it comes to using electronic ballots?\\n\\nYes, the Act has not set out any rules for voting by \\\"electronic or telephonic means\\\". This means it's up to the condo corporation to set the rules in their bylaws. However, condos should be mindful that their electronic voting methods not impact the voting rights of owners currently recognized under the Act.\\n\\nConsider another scenario: an owner votes by advance electronic ballot weeks prior to their meeting. The same owner then subsequently decides that he/she wants to appoint a proxy holder to attend and vote at the meeting on their behalf. We think this owner should be able to submit a proxy form that overrides their initial ballot. Similarly, if the same owner now wishes to attend and vote at the meeting, we think this owner’s vote should replace the initial ballot that was cast weeks prior. \\n\\n>**Proxies provide the flexibility of an owner to change their mind right up until the last minute, it only makes sense that electronic balloting afford the same rights.**\\n\\nIn the absence of any Ministry guidance on this matter, however, condo corporations should confer with their legal counsel to ensure that the rules for balloting are consistent with the owners current rights and abide by what is set out in the Act.\\n\\n\\n##Are there situations where electronic proxies or ballots are preferable?\\n\\nAdvance electronic balloting is best used ...\\n\\n1. **For simple meetings with one election and plenty of candidates**; and \\n\\n2. **When an election involves heated politics (eg. removal of directors)** - In heated political situations, anonymity is key and balloting can be done anonymously.  \\n\\nElectronic proxies are better in almost every other situation because of the flexibility it provides the owner and corporation. The following are two situations where they are especially useful in:\\n\\n1. **When a meeting involves a bylaw vote** - Many condo corporations have difficulty passing bylaws which is why proxies might be the preferred route. From our experience, we have seen that when given a choice, unsure owners defer their vote to their proxy holder. Additionally, some corporations need to hold multiple meetings before they collect enough votes to pass the bylaw - proxies are valid for a meeting's adjournments. \\n\\n2. **When no candidates have notified the Corporation of their intent to run prior to the meeting** - Owners can defer their votes to the proxy holder such that, if someone nominates themselves at the owners' meeting, the proxy holder can make an informed decision at the time and cast the votes accordingly.\\n\\nCondo corporations should confer with their lawyer when it comes to strategizing on how to best use electronic proxies and/or ballots.

This post is a chance for me to elaborate on my talk and also to provide some suggestions on how the Ministry can improve on it.\\n\\n### The Prescribed Proxy\\n\\nThe updated Act brings with it a set of new prescribed forms. Head on over to the Ontario Government's Website under [Land Registration Documents](https://www.ontario.ca/search/land-registration?field_forms_act_tid=all&page=3&sort=desc) to see them all. The Standardized Proxy can be found on the Government's site, but here's a direct link to it for convenience:\\n\\n- [https://files.ontario.ca/proxy\\\\_form\\\\_en.pdf](https://files.ontario.ca/proxy_form_en.pdf)\\n\\nIf you haven't seen the prescribed proxy, it's basically a standardized interactive PDF form - the idea being that owners would download this form, fill out the required information, save it, and then email it (or print and deliver) it back to the condo corporation. \\n\\n### The Good\\n\\nStandardizing the form removes the ability for unscrupulous boards to add language into the proxy that would benefit them. \\n\\nIn the \\\"old\\\" way of doing things, condos would usually supply a proxy form with their meeting notice package. The proxy would already have language defined for the business taking place at their meeting. All owners would need to do is fill in a few blank fields and then sign and date it. It was pretty simple for for owners to fill out actually. \\n\\nHowever, we've seen some pretty nasty examples of condo supplied proxies that clearly favoured the corporation. In one instance we saw the inclusion of language that would transform owners who _abstained_ from voting on a bylaw to actually vote _in favour_ of said bylaw. \\n\\n![](https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2017/11/ur7ip-1.jpg)\\n\\nAbstentions _are_ a valid choice by an owner and changing it without the owner's consent is wrong (and probably very illegal). With the new prescribed form, the above can't happen because the language on the proxy is \\\"locked\\\" by the government.\\n\\nFortunately, the above wasn't something that happened often as the majority of condos operate legitimately. \\n\\n### The Bad\\n\\nYou can't open the thing. If you've already tried to download and open the file then you'd have probably seen this...\\n\\n![Requires Adobe Reader](https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2017/11/proxy_form_1.JPG)\\n\\nThe new form requires Adobe Reader, which means you can't open it on a mobile device - [over 51% of all internet traffic is now done on mobile devices](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/mobile-internet-use-passes-desktop-for-the-first-time-study-finds/). \\n\\nAnd not everyone has Adobe on their computer. You can't expect owners to download another program just to complete their proxy - they won't.\\n\\n### The Ugly\\n\\nIt's complicated. Have you seen it? Well no, because you can't open it. But if you could you'd see it's a three page form with about a billion places to fill in, with every type of meeting business listed, even if it's not on the agenda. \\n\\nHere it is in all it's glory:\\n\\n![The new interactive prescribed form](https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2017/11/bill106_proxy_official-2.gif)\\n\\nOne Property Manager I talked to likened the new proxy to  personal tax forms with all the boxes and places to fill in.\\n\\nThe onus is *now* on the owner to fill out everything correctly, which they won't know how to do without doing their research or being guided by an expert. The problem with this is that the proxy form is too much work - owners just won't bother. The cognitive overload of a form as daunting as this will ultimately lead to frustration.\\n\\nAnd what happens if the owner fills it out wrong? What if they check the wrong box and enter their vote in the wrong field?  Does the whole proxy become invalidated, or will the incorrectly completed sections be disregarded? The Act does not specify, which means it's up to the chairperson of the meeting to decide, which can lead to all sorts of trouble.\\n\\nThe new proxy form also doesn't account for every situation - for example we've dealt with meetings that have the following business on their agenda:\\n\\n- an election of directors\\n- a bylaw to increase the number of directors\\n- another election to elect directors should the bylaw succeed\\n\\nThe standardized form does not provide a way to service the meeting described above. Granted, those meetings are fairly rare - an edge case - but creating a standard form implies that it should be usable for any meeting and should be able to account for all cases.\\n\\nI understand what the government is trying to do with the standardized form - by controlling the language used in the proxy, the government is ensuring that  boards cannot manipulate proxies so that it favors them. But fixing it in this way just introduces other problems - perhaps more serious than those that existed before the prescribed form.\\n\\n### Fixing the prescribed proxy\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n**1) Don't make it an Adobe protected PDF form (obviously).** \\n\\nIf the problem is that the form can't be interactive without Adobe then drop the interactivity. Interactivity is nice and all, but it won't matter if an owner can't open it.\\n\\n**2) Modularize the proxy**\\n\\nCreate modules with standardized language that can be slotted into the proxy as required. This would allow corporations to customize the form so that it's specific to their meeting. It'll keep forms minimal and reduce the overall length of the form - all good things as it drops the cognitive overload for the individual completing the proxy.\\n\\nThe first page and a half of the new prescribed form is actually pretty good - right up past the line of...\\n\\n> _\\\"I (we) revoke all proxies previously given.\\\"_\\n\\nEverything after that point should be modularized and only included on the form if it applies to the specific meeting. You'd get a lot of flexibility this way and would be able to create a proxy that would fit any required meeting scenario while remaining compliant with the Act.\\n\\nThis is actually almost like the preliminary Forms 8, 9 and 10 that were revoked in favor of the current prescribed proxy. I liked those forms, I just thought they needed a few more to account for missing scenarios.\\n\\n### GetQuorum has got you covered\\n\\nRegardless of whether fixes come to the prescribed form or not, GetQuorum clients can feel safe knowing that our proxy tool has got this problem solved. Our tool takes the owner's answers and populates the proxy as required.  \\n\\nSo if you're already using our system to collect proxies then you won't have to worry.

But if\nyou could you'd see it's a three page form with about a billion places to fill\nin, with every type of meeting business listed, even if it's not on the agenda.\n\nHere it is in all it's glory:\n\n\n\nOne Property Manager I talked to likened the new proxy to personal tax forms\nwith all the boxes and places to fill in.\n\nThe onus is now  on the owner to fill out everything correctly, which they won't\nknow how to do without doing their research or being guided by an expert. The\nproblem with this is that the proxy form is too much work - owners just won't\nbother. The cognitive overload of a form as daunting as this will ultimately\nlead to frustration.\n\nAnd what happens if the owner fills it out wrong? What if they check the wrong\nbox and enter their vote in the wrong field? Does the whole proxy become\ninvalidated, or will the incorrectly completed sections be disregarded? The Act\ndoes not specify, which means it's up to the chairperson of the meeting to\ndecide, which can lead to all sorts of trouble.\n\nThe new proxy form also doesn't account for every situation - for example we've\ndealt with meetings that have the following business on their agenda:\n\n * an election of directors\n * a bylaw to increase the number of directors\n * another election to elect directors should the bylaw succeed\n\nThe standardized form does not provide a way to service the meeting described\nabove. Granted, those meetings are fairly rare - an edge case - but creating a\nstandard form implies that it should be usable for any meeting and should be\nable to account for all cases.\n\nI understand what the government is trying to do with the standardized form - by\ncontrolling the language used in the proxy, the government is ensuring that\nboards cannot manipulate proxies so that it favors them. But fixing it in this\nway just introduces other problems - perhaps more serious than those that\nexisted before the prescribed form.\n\nFixing the prescribed proxy\n\n1) Don't make it an Adobe protected PDF form (obviously).\n\nIf the problem is that the form can't be interactive without Adobe then drop the\ninteractivity. Interactivity is nice and all, but it won't matter if an owner\ncan't open it.\n\n2) Modularize the proxy\n\nCreate modules with standardized language that can be slotted into the proxy as\nrequired. This would allow corporations to customize the form so that it's\nspecific to their meeting. It'll keep forms minimal and reduce the overall\nlength of the form - all good things as it drops the cognitive overload for the\nindividual completing the proxy.\n\nThe first page and a half of the new prescribed form is actually pretty good -\nright up past the line of...\n\n> \"I (we) revoke all proxies previously given.\"\n\n\nEverything after that point should be modularized and only included on the form\nif it applies to the specific meeting. You'd get a lot of flexibility this way\nand would be able to create a proxy that would fit any required meeting scenario\nwhile remaining compliant with the Act.\n\nThis is actually almost like the preliminary Forms 8, 9 and 10 that were revoked\nin favor of the current prescribed proxy. I liked those forms, I just thought\nthey needed a few more to account for missing scenarios.\n\nGetQuorum has got you covered\nRegardless of whether fixes come to the prescribed form or not, GetQuorum\nclients can feel safe knowing that our proxy tool has got this problem solved.\nOur tool takes the owner's answers and populates the proxy as required.\n\nSo if you're already using our system to collect proxies then you won't have to\nworry. Our process is still super easy for owners to complete and complies with\nthe new prescribed form.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about the new prescribed proxy?\nDo you agree with our thoughts? Disagree?

In this Toronto Star\narticle\n[https://www.thestar.com/business/real_estate/2017/07/25/ontario-to-roll-out-new-rules-for-condo-boards.html]\n, Mario Deo, a well respected lawyer in the Ontario condo market had this to\nsay...\n\n> “The way of eliminating proxy fraud is by eliminating proxies,” said Deo. “No\nmatter how many rules you pass, proxy fraud is something you can’t eliminate.”\n\n\nWell, ya can't get rid of proxies.\n\nI understand Mr. Deo's frustrations, it's one shared by many in the condo\nindustry. But the real problem is that paper proxies are easy to defraud.\n\nI'm not just saying this because I run an electronic proxy voting service for\ncondos. I'm saying this because there really aren't any better options if\nproxies are eliminated entirely. Owners would be forced to attend their Annual\nGeneral Meetings in person if they want to vote. But...\n\nOwners don't want to go to their AGMs.\nUnder the Condo Act, a meeting must be attended by at least 25% of owners in\norder for it to be valid. It is a known problem in the industry that condos\nstruggle to reach \"quorum\" at their AGMs. Let that sink in - a 200 unit condo\nregularly struggles to get 50 owners to show up to a meeting.\n\nBut why? The average selling price of a Condo in Toronto is about $500K\nnowadays. Shouldn't owners be more concerned with their investments?\n\nWhy the apathy?\nHere's what we often hear from owners that don't attend their meetings:\n\n * \"It's not at a good time.\"\n   \n   \n * \"Meetings are boring.\"\n   \n   \n * \"I'm not in the country.\"\n   \n   \n * \"I'm busy (or) I have better things to do.\"\n   \n   \n\nSo apathy in this case is an owner weighing their choices about their investment\nand actively choosing not to participate in their condo's governance. Something\nneeds to exist to allow owners to be easily represented at their AGM without\nneeding to be there in person. That's what a proxy is for - and electronic\nproxies just make things so much better.\n\nElectronic proxies eliminate the core problems that contribute to fraud in paper\nproxies.\n 1. They reliably identify the voter by requiring authentication before\n    submission.\n    \n    \n 2. Records of the proxies are retained digitally.\n    \n    \n 3. They can be audited at any time.\n    \n    \n\nElectronic Proxies Increase Owner Representation.\nOur data shows that condos can double  their owner representation by proxy when\nelectronic proxies become available. In one case we tripled\n[https://getquorum.com/blog/getquorum-at-50-absolute/]  the owner representation\nfor a client. Increased engagement serves to further reduce proxy fraud as\ncondos can more confidently reject suspicious paper proxies.\n\nAnd owners want it.\nIn this day and age, people demand convenience - technology has seen to that.\nSynchronous events are viewed as being too restrictive. If the Condo Industry\nwants to eliminate proxy fraud and increase owner engagement, they should be\nlooking at ways to easily allow owners to be involved on their own time. We need\nto put ourselves in the shoes of the typical owner and ask, \"How can we make it\neasier\"?\n\nDo you want to use electronic proxies for your next Annual General Meeting?\nClick here to tell us about your condo [http://eepurl.com/cXCp0z]  and we'll be\nin touch.","feature_image":"https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2017/07/roberto-nickson-178565.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5ca1773605a0fd0026af827f","created_at":"2017-07-27T14:40:56.000Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T05:18:19.000Z","published_at":"2017-07-27T19:58:05.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca1773705a0fd0026af82c4","uuid":"a6f40085-9036-4f95-95a9-e5bccbdd7db8","title":"How will the Condominium Management Services Act affect proxy collection?","slug":"how-will-the-cmsa-affect-proxy-collection","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Once the Condominium Management Services Act (CMSA) comes into effect, the CMSA will require that condominium management providers and condominium managers to be licensed in order to provide services.

Use a secure, independent, and auditable electronic proxy voting system like\n    GetQuorum to prevent fraud and owner conflict.","feature_image":"https://d13qu023z75971.cloudfront.net/2017/05/3375_image1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5ca1773605a0fd0026af827f","created_at":"2017-05-02T20:59:23.000Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T23:34:09.000Z","published_at":"2017-05-16T14:58:31.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca1773705a0fd0026af82c6","uuid":"32dbc570-a332-478a-b80f-a39a7e3bee82","title":"Video: Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations in Condos — Everything You Need to Know in 20 Minutes","slug":"video-electric-vehicle-ev-charging-stations-in-condominium-buildings-everything-you-need-to-know","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"With the increasing prominence of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, property managers are now facing pressure to accommodate residents who own such vehicles.

I swear) found themselves in a bit of a pickle.  \\n\\n_(We’ll call this person Jon.)_\\n\\nJon was concerned about a major project that his condo was undertaking. He tried voicing his concerns with his property manager and the condo board, but felt like no one was listening to him.  So to channel his frustrations he started his own Facebook page and invited his neighbours to take part in this group.  \\n\\nSince this major project was a hot topic in his condo, the members in the group grew quickly and eventually the discussions began to get out of hand.  \\n\\nMembers of the group began speculating about how this major project had some potentially questionable aspects. \\n\\nSome owners started calling other owners names. \\n\\nUnpleasant rumours started to fly. \\n\\nEventually the corporation decided that they needed to de-escalate the situation for fear that their reputation (and property values) become damaged due to the contents of the message board becoming public.\\n\\nIn the end, Jon shut down the message board after getting a cease-and-desist letter from the condo.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI have the unique advantage of seeing this story from both sides - as an owner as well as a condo board director.  \\n\\nAs an owner, I too would feel discouraged if I felt that no one was receptive to my take on important condo matters.  \\n\\nAs a condo board director I understand all of the potential risks to the corporation when unsubstantiated information begins to freely flow within a community. \\n\\n### Resident Message Boards: A Solution to Communication Complaints?\\n\\nWe’ve heard complaints from owners that condos don’t communicate often enough.  Condos will need to consider the manner in which they communicate with residents that balances how much information to share and how to manage the communication process.   \\n\\nA question that is commonly raised among condo communities is: **“Do we set up a message board for our residents?”**\\n\\nThere are a couple of considerations that need to be taken into account: will the message board be condominium managed or community managed?  There are advantages and disadvantages to both types which we will explore below.\\n\\n#### Condo Managed Message Boards ###\\n\\nCondo managed message boards are usually hosted as a feature of one of the condominium software providers or as part of the condo website.

Allowing others to post personally identifying information, bullying other owners, and spreading rumours can lead to lawsuits.  \\n\\nHere's an example: the courts recently concluded that a condo corporation had a statutory duty to take all reasonable steps to [protect the reputation of it's directors from defamation](http://condoadviser.ca/2017/07/condo-directors-should-be-protected-against-defamatory-statements/condo-law-blog-Ontario). \\n\\nCommunity run discussion boards that get out of hand or post potentially damaging information could see legal action against its founders or moderators.\\n\\nIt’s not just disseminating false information either, I’ve seen examples of condo corporations taking legal action against community run message boards out of fear that _any_ negative content can become public.

We have seen message boards started with good intentions, but end up overtaken by a vocal minority who have an agenda, or a grudge against a neighbour or corporation employee.  \\n\\n### Good Idea, Requires Commitment\\n\\nA good open forum for discussion needs two things:\\n\\n1. commitment by one or more individuals to balanced moderation; and\\n2. proper education of the forum's participants on what is acceptable content.\\n\\n### Alternatives\\n\\nIf you don’t think that your condo is ready for a message board, there are other ways of keeping your  community informed as a condo board:\\n\\n+ set up a blog and post regularly; and\\n+ send a monthly newsletter\\n\\nBoth of these options work exceptionally well when they coincide with your monthly board meetings.\\n\\nIf you are set on a message board, then you should keep in mind that managing and moderating a message board can be time consuming, and you may not have control over community managed message boards that pop up.  \\n\\nMany discussion forums start out strong only to fade into oblivion once owners and residents lose interest or get caught up in the busyness of their lives.
